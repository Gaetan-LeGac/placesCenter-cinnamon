# Places Center Cinnamon applet, with distant places (FTP & SSH) and file manager forcing

![Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gaetan-LeGac/placesCenter-cinnamon/master/preview.png "Preview")

My fork brings the ability to:

* Select a specific file manager to open directories
* Add a Â« Distant Places Â» section for FTP and SSH shortcuts in the menu

The format to define SFTP/SSH shortcurts is simply:

> Name = Address
